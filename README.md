# krypto
A Kotlin library for strong, two-way encryption.

## Overview
`krypto` makes strong, two-way encryption easier to deal with - and it's written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) to boot!
`krypto` is more or less a wrapper around the [Java Cryptography Architecture](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html) (JCA) API, making it easier to use from Kotlin applications. This library was _not necessarily_ designed with maximum flexibility in mind.
Instead it forces the use of _strong_ techniques for encryption.
